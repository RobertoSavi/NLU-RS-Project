    \item \textit{a summary of what you have done}
\end{itemize}
\section{Implementation details (max approx. 200-300 words)}
Do not explain the backbone deep neural network (e.g. RNN or BERT). Instead, focus on what you did on top of it. \textbf{Add references if you take inspiration from the code of others}

\section{Results}
Add tables and explain how you evaluated your model. Tables and images of plots or confusion matrices do not count in the page limit.
